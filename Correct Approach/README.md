# Stage 2

## Organization

### Data folder
In this folder, you will find all the data we got from our performance test. We separated the file from the global tests and the tests for the scalability calculation.

### Instruction folder
In this folder, you will find important files which will help to setup the VMs with Kafka and Zookeeper to launch properly the tests.
Here is the description of the files :
- Setup of the VMs | Wurstmeister-VM-setup.md
- Preparation for the tests | Test-performing.md

### Script folder
In this folder, we stored the scripts we used to send messages for our tests and the script to parse the data.
The parsing script allowed us to properly analyze the data.
