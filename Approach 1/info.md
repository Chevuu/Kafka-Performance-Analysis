# What is Kafka?

Kafka is an open-source, distributed event streaming platform that enables developers to build real-time event-driven applications at scale. It allows for the collection, storage, and processing of data to create high-performance data pipelines.

## How Kafka Works

- Kafka serves as a message broker between systems, helping exchange data efficiently.

- In Kafka, there are two primary components: producers and consumers.

- Producers generate and publish messages to the Kafka server. This Kafka server contains Kafka topics. Messages are actually published to topics.

- Consumers retrieve and process these messages directly from the Kafka server.

- Kafka can be scaled by adding more producers, brokers (Kafka servers), and consumers, providing architectural advantages for scalability and high availability.

By using Kafka, companies can streamline data interactions, reduce coupling between systems, and ensure efficient data exchange in growing and complex environments.
