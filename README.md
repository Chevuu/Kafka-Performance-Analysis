# Project Repository
This repository encompasses two main sections, each serving distinct purposes for the project at hand: Correct Approoach and Reported Approach. Used one in 1st stage of the project is Reported Approach so you can directly jump to that if you wish. Below, we detail the contents and utility of each section:

## Stage 2 - Correct Approoach
Correct Approoach contains the preferred configuration and setup for the project. This version is designed for enhanced compatibility and future use, particularly in the context of **Stage 2**. This setup ensures better scalability and adaptability for running the project on multiple machines, making it a suitable choice for subsequent project stages.

## Stage 1 - Reported approach
Under Reported Approach, you will find the configuration used for **Stage 1** of the project. This setup employs docker-compose for orchestrating the project's components. It is worth noting that this configuration is not as suitable for running on multiple machines so thus approach will have to be changed for **Stage 2**. This approach may be helpful for initial project setup and understanding.

Please refer to the contents in the Reported Approach section for detailed commands and instructions pertaining to Project **Stage 1**.
